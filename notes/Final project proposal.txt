Final project proposal

Abstract 


We decided to create a Data Pipeline on AWS that could facilitate the process of building a Natural Language Processing tool. The tool will utilize a simple machine learning algorithm or one/two layer neural network to train a topic modeler or sentiment analyzer or a recommender. The technologies (tentative) that will be used in this project


* Lambda and SAM to streamline a simple ETL data pipeline that extracts, processes, and load the data from Twitter API 
* Eventbridge(Cloudwatch events) to log and monitor state changes 
* S3 Bucket to store the raw retrieved data (potentially utilize DynamoDB to store the parsed and processed data for future analytics)
* Sagemaker to create a notebook for hosting the ML project code, fine-tuning  parameters, pipelining and storing the models
* Pandas to ingest and wrangle the data and preprocess it for ML training
* EC2 to create a VM that hosts the workflow or provide workers for training if needed 
* (Tentative) DynamoDB to store a structured version of the output data for future reference 


Outline 


The downstream tasks (roughly) will look like below


* Pulling Data Twitter Data from API or Scraping tweets using 3rd party lib triggered by Lambda 
* Data preprocessing into clean format and storing into S3
* Creating a Sagemaker notebook 
* Ingest data and data wrangling 
* Generate Machine Learning Model readable embeddings
* Choosing a model to classify 
* Inference Pipeline 
* Potentially hosting the model on a EC2 instance
