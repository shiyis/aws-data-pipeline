Rolling notes
Final Project title: AWS Data Pipeline 
Final Project Phases: Demo date 11/22-23 (7 weeks)


* We will tentatively starting from week2 have a quick standup meeting(about 15 to 20 minutes; 5:00pm before the training session assuming that the session won’t start early than 5:30) daily to discuss about task progress for each person and provision things to do for the next week at the end of the current week (Friday of each week)

Week3 (10/17/22/ - 10/21/22)
* Tools involved 
   * AWS(tentative)
      * AWS Eventbridge
         * Log data streaming events on AWS kinesis if we have decided that we want to utilize the technology
      * AWS Kinesis 
         * Streamline our data pipeline to retrieve large amounts of data
      * DynamoDB
         * For storing key-value pairs between the processed and raw data 
         * Raw data will be stored on s3
   * Other new tech involved 
      * None

         * VS code
         * Numpy
         * Pandas 
Responsibilities
   * Shiyi to have the data pulling pipeline setup and run a single streaming event
   * Patrick to have taken the first batch of data pulled from the api in transformed it and stored on our s3 bucket; 
   * William to have been able to receive logs of the streaming event and understood how to manage to create a daily schedule to run the pipeline
   * Kenneth to have adjusted the terraform configuration and created the final template for the technologies that we are using on AWS

Week2 (10/10/22 - 10/14/22; starting stand-up meeting)
Tools involved 
AWS(tentative)
      * AWS Lambda 
         * Creating serverless functions in Python to run things 
      * AWS S3
         * Storing data we pulled from data pipeline
      * awswrangler 
         * SDK for data wrangling with Pandas on AWS
      * Boto3
         * AWS Package for Python
      * AWS CLI
         * Command line access to create IAM templates, uploading policies, manage roles, etc 
      * AWS CloudWatch 
         * Getting Logs of data streaming events and creating notifications from data streaming 
Other new tech involved 
      * Social media API (Instagram, facebook, or Twitter)
         * Devices that we are pulling data from
      * Pandas
         * To parquet and wrangle the image data
      * Numpy
         * We will use numpy to transform the image data 
      * Zoom 
         * Zoom for daily standup meeting (15 minutes)
      * Terraform 
         * Template scripting aws cloud management and automation 
Ongoing 
      * AWS
         * None
      * Other
         * Monday.com 
         * Discord 
         * Zoom 
         * Terraform
         * VS code
         * Google drive




Responsibilities
   * Shiyi to research about data pulling from different APIs and settle on what data to collect (either image data currently from instagram or language data)


   * Patrick to research about data transformation and wrangling in Python (Numpy and pandas; aws has a tool called awswrangler which is an aws sdk for pandas); have settled on what kind of policies are attached which role we are creating 


   * William to research about getting notifications from data streaming events, cron scheduling, logs of streaming data, etc 


   * Kenneth to create terraform template if we have settled on all the aws services we want to use (currently technologies that we are definitely using is an s3 bucket; aws lambda; technologies that we might use aws kinesis and EC2)
